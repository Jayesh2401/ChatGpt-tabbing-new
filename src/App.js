                Happy Valentine's Day! Today, and every day, I want you to know
                how much you mean to me. You are my rock, my partner in crime,
                and my best friend. I am so grateful to have you by my side, and
                I am constantly amazed by your strength, kindness, and
                unwavering love.
              </p>
              <p>
                You make every day brighter just by being in it, and I am so
                grateful for the love and laughter that we share. Your smile is
                my sunshine, and your laughter is my favourite sound. I feel so
                lucky to be your husband, and I promise to spend the rest of my
                life making you feel loved, cherished, and appreciated.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope this Valentine's Day is filled with all of your favourite
                things and that you know how much I love you. I may not be able
                to be with you today, but know that you are always in my
                thoughts and in my heart. With all my love,
              </p>
              <p>With all my love,</p>
